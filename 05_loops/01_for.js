// also called iterations

for (let index = 0; index < 10; ++index) {
    console.log(index)
}
// init-condition-block exe-update

// break -> breaks out of for
// continue -> goes to the top for next iteration skipping the current execution

// nested loops also possible -- everything same as other programming langauges
// same logic like everywhere
